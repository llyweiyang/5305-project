Here's the code for the project I have on Speaker Identification Using Pitch and MFCC.

First, one needs to click on the following URL to my Dropbox to download the 1. 3GB dataset

https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ksxnir8ljwej5lntoypjd/h?rlkey=f7gytp6o96smcaravzvl1mag1&dl=0

The code can then be run by placing the commonvoice folder in the same directory as the five m files on github

In addition, the five images here are plots of the accuracy results for the corresponding cases, and one image is an example of the storage location

project.m is the main code file, the other m files are based on this file to make some changes

Many thanks to the instructor for being able to read, download the dataset and run the code.
